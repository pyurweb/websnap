    # WebSnap.new takes the HTML and any options for wkhtmltoimage
    # run `wkhtmltoimage -H` for a full list of options
    snap = WebSnap::Snapper.new('http://google.com', :format => 'png')

    # Get the binary image data
    png = snap.to_bytes

    # Save the PDF to a file
    file = snap.to_file('/path/to/save/png')
    
    # WebSnap.new can optionally accept a URL or a File.
